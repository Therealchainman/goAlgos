# Go Notes

If I feel like organizing this more I will later.  But for now it is very simple, and updated whenever I find something
useful for competitive programming in golang or any interesting algorithms that I want to record.  This will probably 
be focused on interesting algorithms/datastructures, and functions that I add to the libraries for the time being.
